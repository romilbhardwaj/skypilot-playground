# skypilot-playground
Creates a public playground for people to play with SkyPilot

```console
sky launch -c playground --env API_URL=<API_URL> --env PLAYGROUND_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD> playground.yaml
```

## Notes
* Make sure port 7681 is open on your remote VM!
* This sets up a very basic username password based auth. Use with caution!
